git remote
show all remotes for a repository

git remote <name> <url>
add a remote of name and url
if a repository only has one remote the name is typically "origin"

git push <remote> <branch>
push all commits accessible from branch to remote

git pull <remote> <branch>
works exactly like push, just in the opposite direction

git config --global --add remote.origin.proxy ""
